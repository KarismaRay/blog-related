# Vaadin 10: SASS Integration and CSS-Refresh Development Workflow

```bash
mvn sass:watch

# start application and open http://localhost:8080/

# change sass

# profit (= css will be updated in the browser without a page reload)
```

Mind to execute at least `mvn sass:update-stylesheets` once up front before starting the app.
